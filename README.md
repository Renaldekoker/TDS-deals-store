Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The app will also use a MockApiServer in development mode, to use the production for testing purposes run `npm run serve-prod`

### Docker Compose 

For ease of use I added a Docker configuration to emulate a production environment.

You need to have Docker Compose installed. 

Run `docker-compose up`

Navigate to `0.0.0.0` / `localhost`

### Production Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
